title: How do I become a member of the Alumni Association e.V?
subtitle: Article 4 of our [Charter](/documents/charter/english/) describes the process of how to become a member of the Alumni Association e.V. 
---

1. You can apply to become a member at portal.jacobs-alumni.de or provide answers to all the questions in the Alumni Portal via email (we strongly recommend the portal sign-up to provide optimal data security and a fast approval).
2. The Board will review your application and approve or reject it (so far we have not rejected any complete applications). 
3. Once you receive a confirmation of your membership in writing (via email, for example) your membership starts.
