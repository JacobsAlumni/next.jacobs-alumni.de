title: Why can’t I automatically become a member of the Alumni Association after Graduation?
subtitle: The Alumni Association is a legal body independent from the University. According to German law (and similar in many other countries), in order to become a member of an association, an act of explicit consent from each individual is required. It is not allowed to force people to be part of an organization or to subscribe them implicitly.

From the very beginning in 2004, the Jacobs graduates received invitations to sign up for the Alumni Association after Graduation in the form of a registration on the online Alumni Portal “AlmaLink” (superseded by our own [Alumni Portal](https://portal.jacobs-alumni.de) in 2017).
The University has always supported the Alumni Association in this process since the membership was connected with the activation of an Alumni Account and the possibility of communicating with Alumni after the end of their studies.

From 2017, in order to foster membership growth, the University and the Association designed a new campaign, targeting the third year students in the 6th semester as well as informing all other students during O-Week about the amazing opportunity of being part of the Jacobs Alumni network.
Even in this case, the students are asked to expressively state their interest to, in the future, be part of the Association and to give their consent to be informed about the Association’s activities, and are e.g. not automatically subscribed to its newsletter.
